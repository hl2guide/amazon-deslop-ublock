# Amazon Deslop - Hide AI, Bloat, Greenwashing, Manipulative Marketing

 So you can read human reviews and compare prices in peace.



## What it hides

- **AI-generated content:** review summaries, Rufus shopping assistant, and "Ask AI" prompts
- **Sponsored placements:** sponsored products in search results, ad carousels, and Amazon Live
- **Algorithmic recommendations:** "frequently bought together," "customers also viewed," and similar upsell carousels
- **Manipulative pricing visuals:** red price colors, flashy deal badges, countdown timers, and strikethrough reference prices (prices and deal info stay, just without the visual pressure)
- **Greenwashing and marketing badges:** Climate Pledge Friendly, "Amazon's Choice," bestseller, and exclusive labels
- **Amazon self-promotion:** cross-links to Kindle, Prime, and other Amazon products and services
- **Interface bloat:** pop-ups, flyouts, homepage suggestion decks, and navbar/footer clutter
- **Sections of product pages that promote sellers or manufacturers** without customer benefit
- **Price-feedback prompts:** "seen it cheaper elsewhere?" forms that feed Amazon's price tracking

## What it modifies instead of hiding

- **Vine reviews:** restyled as a warning (" Received free product – verify claims independently") rather than removed
- **Deal and discount badges:** some are toned down to plain neutral styling instead of hidden, so you can still see a deal exists
- **Deal prices:** remain fully visible; only the attention-grabbing colors and animations are neutralized

## Optional filters (commented out by default)

Enable these manually in "My filters" if you want a more aggressive cleanup:

- **Empty homepage:** removes the entire homepage feed (ads and algorithmic recommendations)
- **Hide Prime badges:** removes Prime logos on products (kept as Prime delivery info can be genuinely useful)
- **Hide gift options** in the cart
- **Remove delivery location** from the navbar (postal code / city)
- **Hide all card widgets** for minimalist browsing

## Notes

- These are cosmetic filters and they hide elements, they don't block network requests
- Amazon changes some parts of it's markup frequently and constantly has new ideas to make your experience more cluttered; create [an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/clairekardas/amazon-deslop-ublock/issues/new) with screenshots and links if you come accross errors
- Tested on and adjusted for every Amazon locale (.com, .de, .fr, .es, .com.au,...), perhaps to the detriment of my sanity
- Primarily focused on desktop; mobile layout contributions welcome!
